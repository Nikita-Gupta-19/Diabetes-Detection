## 🧠 Project Overview

This C++ project simulates a personalized diabetes checkup system. It enables patients to log in, take diabetes-related tests, book appointments, and receive risk assessments and diet suggestions. The admin can manage appointments, records, and respond to patient queries. The system is file-based and built using core C++ principles such as OOP, file handling, and dynamic memory allocation.
